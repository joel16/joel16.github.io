<pre><code>
Implemented digital time and day/night widget.
Includes battery status, which displays 20-100 in incremental of 20's and charging status.
Implemented basic lock screen. Press L to activate and 'A' on the lock icon to unlock. That's all it does for now.
Implemented navigation bar. Touching the back button on the bottom screen takes you back to a previous state. Touching the home button takes you home.
Implemented Power menu. Press 'Y' will open the power menu.
Implemented settings. Only certain functions work as of now, such as About, Performance -> Storage Management and Developer Options.

Displays SD storage and CTR NAND storage statuses
Implemented Developer Options which lets you do the following:

Toggle experimental features. - This needs to be turned on to access some restricted features that are still heavily a work in progress. (These include the swap display toggle, file manager and other features under the hood.)
Switch display toggle (Doesn't work yet, but can be turned on after enabling experimental features. I'd advise you not to do since it has barely been touched).
Fixed WiFi status. Now displays WiFi Status correctly in a range from NULL to 3 (Null, 0, 1, 2, 3)
Date and time is now displayed properly. This includes day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc) and date (1-28/29/30/31) and month.
File checks have been fixed. Certain settings no longer resets upon reboot.
Fixed missing backdrop asset in app drawer when dark theme is enabled.
Slightly improved quick settings. It is currently disabled until it is fully fixed.
Added model check for N3DS models. If detected performance boost will be enabled.
Slightly improved speed by loading all fonts at start up, rather than loading and unloading in real time.
Fixed many mis-alignment issues.
Made many code clean ups and changes to improve overall stability.
