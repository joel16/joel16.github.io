### 3DShell Bleeding edge builds [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/joel16/3DShell.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/joel16/3DShell) [![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/joel16/3DShell/total.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/joel16/3DShell/releases)

3DShell's bleeding edge builds are only generated once a commit has been pushed and the build is succesfully deployed. The binary is replaced with the most recent build each time, therefore the user cannot go back to an older build unless they choose an offical release version.

```
Caution: These builds are not tested. Use them at your own risk.
```
